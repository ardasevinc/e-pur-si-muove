# A Tribute Page For Galieo Galilei

This project is an assignment of freeCodeCamp.

## Aim

My goal is to make 3 versions.

1. Not using flexbox or grid (this is hosted on github pages)
2. Using flexbox
3. Using grid 

All versions will be fully responsive.

**current status**: (1) is 80% complete.
It's not perfect but works good on mobile.
Can have some problems with footer on tablets.
On desktops the website may have a scrollbar.
on TV's footer may look weird.


## Where?

You can access to a [demo](https://ardasevinc.me/eppur-si-muove).
